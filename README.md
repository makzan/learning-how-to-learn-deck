## Why?

I am taking the class Leaning how to learn course on Coursera. In order to have A checklist of all the essential topics, I created a collection of cards. Each card contain one topic with an illustration and summary.

The card acts as both checklist and flash card.

As a learner, I can go through each card one by one. I can also recall the explanation by hiding the illustrations and summary text.
